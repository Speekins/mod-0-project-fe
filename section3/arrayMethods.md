# Array Methods

#### Array.prototype.pop()
- This method will remove the value in the final index position of the array on which it is called. It will return the value that has been removed.
#### Array.prototype.push()
- This method will add the value (provided by user) to the end of the array on which it is called. It will return the new length of the array.
#### Array.prototype.shift()
- This method will remove the value at index 0 of the array on which it is called, thereby shifting the other values by one index position. .shift() will return the value that was removed.
#### Array.prototype.unshift()
