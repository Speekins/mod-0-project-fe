## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I often take too long to ask questions because it can take a lot of time to formulate the question. The formulation of the question itself seems like a taller task than figuring it out on my own.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- string: a character or series of characters all which exists on the UTF-16 chart, having corresponding codes on that chart.
- number: any number inclusively between 0 and infinity.
- boolean: `true` or `false` (not to be confused with truthy or falsy values)

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
- `console.log("Hello World!")`
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- `// some code`

```
/*
A BLOCK OF CODE
*/
```
- code comments are meant to signify intention to future developers (including oneself).

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable is like a bucket with a name on it. Let's say the bucket's name were "Matchbox cars", what do you imagine that bucket would contain? Matchbox cars obviously. At any point in time, we can change the number of Matchbox cars in the bucket or even what the bucket holds, but we don't change the name of the bucket. If we wanted to change the name of the bucket, we'd throw the original bucket away and get a new one.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
##### Spotify
- artistName: string
- monthlyListeners: number
- isSignedIn: boolean

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- concatenation is the act of combining two things. In programming, that could be two strings, a number and a string, a string and a boolean, etc.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
- Many apps will likely concatenate the user's first and last name (`firstName + lastName`)
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- Considering the blog post about writing Git commits, how do I write a commit message using a text editor (e.g. Vim or Atom) instead of using the one line `-m` command?
