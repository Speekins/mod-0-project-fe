## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
- I thought there was enough direction given in order for me to find the answers I was looking for, and where I can find good answers to my questions in the future. For example, I wouldn't really have thought to look at Youtube for solutions to my coding questions. Good to know for next time.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- Any app that has a shopping cart is most likely an array--more complicated than what we're doing here. But a digital shopping cart is basically a list, which is data that can be contained in an array.
3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- A lot of writing code is using many of the same concepts frequently. Javascript built-in Array methods are designed to accomplish the simple tasks developers need to do more quickly with less code.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- A loop is meant to accomplish one task several times. For example, if a developer wanted to add up all the numbers in an array, regardless of the array's length. This is instead of hard-coding each an every step (`x += array[0], x += array[1]` etc).
A for loop without using an array could be a countdown displayed on a web page.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
"Ok Timmy, think of the microwave you use to warm up a pop-tart every morning. You set the microwave for 15 seconds and it comes out the same way every time. Now imagine one day you have to warm up pop-tarts for 100 of your friends because they all want that pop-tart just the way you always make it. Loops are just like that--they're meant to accomplish a task the same way every time for as many times as you want whether that's once or one hundred times."

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- Is there a good Array method that can accomplish a loop without hard coding a `for` loop every time?
