## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- Both article and video describe the tracking of personal progress. The article uses the acronym S.M.A.R.T.--your goals need to be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. I can't say I've ever been that intentional when it comes to my own learning. In the video, Carmen explains that you can't compare yourself to others when it comes to personal progress, but you can only compare to yourself (your past self).
- I like the concept of the "Zone of Proximal Development". Slowly biting off chunks to take on new concepts is much better than how I sometimes approach learning, which is to bite off more than I can chew.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- My growth mindset show in learning Software Development--I've been slowly learning over the course of the past 18 months. In that time I've learned to go at my own pace, especially considering my current life circumstances (dad of two girls, and working full time).
- I have a fixed mindset when it comes to my current field of work. This is true for a few reasons--I obviously plan to leave this line of work, but I also have noticed that there isn't much left to learn, or much left that I want to learn.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- I didn't really notice until reading this. I appreciate being given the information, but also I appreciate the expectation that I will take responsibility of my own learning thereafter.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- a conditional statement is a set of rules that will change the course of a program depending on the if the data passes the conditional requirements or not. I think of it like the indicator at the entrance to a parking garage (usually a horizontal yellow pole hanging from the ceiling) that says "maximum clearance 10'". This "gate" acts as a conditional statement--is the vehicle passing through <= 10' tall? Or is the vehicle > 10' tall? This determines if the vehicle is allowed to enter, changing the outcome depending on that condition.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- Many conditions can be added after an `if` statement by write `if else` statements (as many as you want), the final being an `else` statement to catch any other circumstance. The program will follow and read the `if/if else/else` statements sequentially top to bottom. At the point the conditional statement is satisfied, the `if` statement block will cease execution.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- `&&` is the "and" operator, and `||` is the "or" operator. These will allow a developer to check that both (`&&`), or either (`||`) of the statements meet that one condition.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- is there a better way to check for a condition using a bunch of `if`s, `if else`s, and `else`s all in a row?
